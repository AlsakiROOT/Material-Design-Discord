# Material Design Discord

An attempt at a Material Design Discord theme using Beautifuldiscord, more material-like updates soon, Private messaging style is currently
broken and I am unsure about square profile pictures amoungst other things,

## Version 1.0 B

v1.x B is the first version of this theme, there will be errors and unstyled areas, a lot more is to come in the future.
In this version it allows better customisation, setting a few variables at the top of the css for easy editing.
