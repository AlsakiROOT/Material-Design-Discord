# Material Design Discord

An attempt at a Material Design Discord theme using Beautifuldiscord, more material-like updates soon, Private messaging style is currently
broken and I am unsure about square profile pictures amoungst other things,

## Current Version 3.0

v3.x is an edited version of 1.x, because I didn't know if people wanted this border wallpaper feature, there will be errors and unstyled areas, a lot more is to come in the future.
In this version it allows better customisation, setting a few variables at the top of the css for easy editing.

We also have the theme with background support (v2.0) [File Tree](https://github.com/Oliyy/Material-Design-Discord/tree/soyouwantabackground) [Release](https://github.com/Oliyy/Material-Design-Discord/releases/tag/2.0)
