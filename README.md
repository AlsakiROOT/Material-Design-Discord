An attempt at a Material Design Discord theme using Beautifuldiscord, more material-like updates soon, Private messaging style is currently
broken and I am unsure about square profile pictures amoungst other things,
Credits:
https://github.com/Oliyy - Pretty much all the rest I made, in consultation with others
https://github.com/jakeoid - I used his light theme restriction code
https://github.com/Vap0r1ze - I edited his repo for adding nitro tags to users names.
https://github.com/AlexFlipnote - I used the scroll bar from his discord theme, because I hate coding scroll bars
