# Material Design Discord

An attempt at a Material Design Discord theme using Beautifuldiscord, more material-like updates soon, Private messaging style is currently
broken and I am unsure about square profile pictures amoungst other things,

### Credits -

https://github.com/Oliyy - Pretty much all the rest I made, in consultation with others

https://github.com/jakeoid - I used his light theme restriction code

https://github.com/Vap0r1ze - I edited his repo for adding nitro tags to users names.

https://github.com/AlexFlipnote - I used the scroll bar from his discord theme, because I hate coding scroll bars



### Guild Sidebar Mention Legend -

RED CIRCLE = UNREAD MESSAGES

PURPLE SQUARE = UNREAD MESSAGES IN SELECTED GUILD

PURPLE CIRCLE WITH NUMBER = @ MENTION
