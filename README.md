# Material Design Discord

An attempt at a Material Design Discord theme using Beautifuldiscord, more material-like updates soon, Private messaging style is currently
broken and I am unsure about square profile pictures amoungst other things,

**We also have the theme with border-background support, because I don't know if people like it enough for it to be on the main release (v3.x) [File Tree](https://github.com/Oliyy/Material-Design-Discord/tree/soyouwantabackground) | [Release](https://github.com/Oliyy/Material-Design-Discord/releases/)**

## Current Version 2.0

v2.x is a seperate version of this theme with a custom wallpaper option, there will be errors and unstyled areas, a lot more is to come in the future.
In this version it allows better customisation, setting a few variables at the top of the css for easy editing.
